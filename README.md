# Building

`python build.py -s <path_to_filter_spirit_executable>`  
`python build.py -s <path_to_filter_spirit_executable> -v variations`  
`python build.py -s <path_to_filter_spirit_executable> -v variations -t toggles`(currently I use this to generate my filters)  
Use `python build.py --help` to see more options.
